# cLoops: loops calling for ChIA-PET, Hi-C and HiChIP
![](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops/raw/master/pngs/cLoops.png)

## Introduction
Chromosome conformation capture (3C) derived high-throughput sequencing methods such as ChIA-PET,HiChIP and Hi-C provide genome-wide view of chromatin organization. Fine scale loops formed by interactions of regulatory elements spanning hundreds kilobases can be detected from these data. Here we introduce cLoops ('see loops'),a common loops calling tool for ChIA-PET, HiChIP and high-resolution Hi-C data. Paired-end tags (PETs) are first classified as self-ligation and inter-ligation clusters using an optimized unsupervisied clustering algorithm. The significances of the inter-ligation clusters are then estimated using permutated local background. 

If you find cLoops useful, please give us a star at github and cite our paper (***in preparation***):    
### cLoops: a clustering based loops calling method for ChIA-PET, Hi-C and HiChIP ###

--------
## Install
[scipy](https://www.scipy.org/),[numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [joblib](https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/) are required. If you have problems for installing scipy, please refer to [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) or [SAGE](http://www.sagemath.org/).
```
wget https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops/archive/0.9.tar.gz
tar xvzf 0.9.tar.gz
cd cLoops-0.9
python setup.py install    
```

To test whether cLoops is successfully installed:
```
cd examples
sh run.sh
```


Please refer to [here](https://docs.python.org/2/install/index.html) to install cLoops to customized path.

--------
## Usage
Run ***cLoops -h*** to see all options. Key parameters are ***eps*** and ***minPts*** . ***minPts*** defines at least how many PETs are required for a candidate loop, ***eps*** defines the distance requried for two PETs being neighbors. For practically usage to tune parameters, using the PETs in the smallest chromosome except chrY and chrM, then run a series of ***eps*** and ***minPts***,all rounds clustering result will be combined to determine your parameters. 

Since version 0.8, cLoops added a parameter **--mode(-m)**, which is the pre-set parameters for different types of data. -m 0 accepts user settings; -m 1 equals -eps 500,1000,2000 -minPts 5 for sharp peak like ChIA-PET data; -m 2 equals -eps 1000,2000,5000 -minPts 5 for broad peak like ChIA-PET data; -m 3 equals -eps 5000,7500,10000 -minPts 20,30,40,50 -hic for deep sequenced Hi-C data (~200 million cis PETs); -m 4 equals -eps 2500,5000,7500,10000 -minPts 20,30 -hic for ~100 million cis PETs HiChIP data;for ~30-40 miilion cis PETs HiChIP data, we suggested -eps 2500,5000,7500,10000 -minPts 10,15,20 -hic. You can always add more eps and smaller minPts to get more candidate loops and maybe more significant loops, however, it takes longer time.

--------
### Input  
Mapped PETs in [BEDPE format](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/general-usage.html), compressed files with gzip are also accepected, following columns are necessary: chrom1 (1st),start1 (2),end1 (3),chrom2 (4),start2 (5),end2 (6),strand1 (9),strand2 (10). For the column of name or score, "." is accepcted.

--------
### Output
The main output is a loop file and a PDF file or PDFs for the plot of self-ligation and inter-ligation PETs distance distributions.
For the .loop file, columns and explaination are as follwing:

column | name | explaination
------ | ---- | ------------
0th | loopId | Id for a loop, like chr1-chr1-1
1th | ES | Enrichment score for the loop, caculated by observed PETs number divided by the mean PETs number of nearby permutated  regions
2th | FDR | false discovery rate for the loop, caculated as the number of permutated regions that there are more observed PETs than the region  
3th | binomal\_p-value | binomal test p-value for the loop
4th | distance | distance (bp) between the centers of the anchors for the loop
5th | hypergeometric\_p-value | hypergeometric test p-value for the loop
6th | iva | genomic coordinates for the left anchor, for example, chr13:50943050-50973634
7th | ivb | genomic coordinates for the right anchor
8th | poisson_p-value | poisson test p-value for the loop
9th | ra | observed PETs number for the left anchor
10th | rab | observed PETs number linking the left and right anchors
11th | rb | observed PETs number for the right anchor
12th | poisson\_p-value\_corrected | Bonferroni corrected poisson p-value according to number of loops for each chromosome
13th | binomal\_p-value\_corrected | Bonferroni corrected binomal p-value according to number of loops for each chromosome
14th | hypergeometric\_p-value\_corrected | Bonferroni corrected hypergeometric p-value according to number of loops for each chromosome
15th | significant | 1 or 0, 1 means we think the loop is significant compared to permutated regions. You can ignore this and customize your cutoffs using above values by visualization a small chromosome in the [Juicebox](https://github.com/theaidenlab/juicebox) or [washU](http://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/).

## Examples
All following examples source data, result and log file can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops_supplementaryData/tree/master/examples).

### 1. ChIA-PET data    
We provide a test data from GM12878 CTCF ChIA-PET ([GSM1872886](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM1872886)), just the chromosome 21 mapped to hg38. Run the command as following then you will get the result if cLoops is successfuly installed. The ***eps*** is auto estimated and default ***minPts*** is 5,**-w** option will generate loops for visualization in [washU browser](http://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/browser/),**-j** option will generate loops for visualization in [Juicebox](https://github.com/theaidenlab/juicebox) .
```
wget https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops/blob/master/examples/GSM1872886_GM12878_CTCF_ChIA-PET_chr21_hg38.bedpe.gz
cLoops -f GSM1872886_GM12878_CTCF_ChIA-PET_chr21_hg38.bedpe.gz -o chiapet -w -j -s -m 1 -plot
```      
For ChIA-PET data with sharp peak, like the CTCF here, you will get the inter-ligation and self-ligation PETs distance distribution like following, the two kinds of PETs well seperated using auto estimated ***eps***:
![](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops/raw/master/pngs/chiapet_disCutoff.png)

If your experimental data doesn't look like this by auto estimated ***eps***, which could be true for some ChIA-PET data with broad peak (like H3K27ac), please use the small chromosome (chr21 in human and chr19 in mouse) run a series of ***eps***, then chose the smallest one that generate the well seperated distance distribution to run cLoops, or just using the series. 

We recommend washU to visualize the loops, by the script jd2washU we can convert the cLoops temp files to washU long range track, and [bedtools](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),[bgzip & tabix](http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html) are needed in the command enviroment. 
```
jd2washU -d chiapet -o chiapet       
``` 

With other ChIP-seq data, you can get following plot:

### 2. HiChIP data   
We provide test data of GM12878 cohesin HiChIP two biological replicates, just the chromosome 21 mapped to hg38. Run the command as following to call merged loops. ***-s*** option is used to keep working directory and temp files, which could be used by scripts of deLoops, jd2washU (BEDTOOLS needed), jd2juice (Juicer needed), jd2fingerprint and jd2saturation. ***-hic*** option means using cutoffs design for Hi-C like data, see above. 
```
wget https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops_supplementaryData/blob/master/examples/GSE80820_GM12878_cohesin_HiChIP_chr21_hg38_bio1.bedpe.gz 
wget https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops_supplementaryData/blob/master/examples/GSE80820_GM12878_cohesin_HiChIP_chr21_hg38_bio2.bedpe.gz 
cLoops -f GSE80820_GM12878_cohesin_HiChIP_chr21_hg38_bio1.bedpe.gz,GSE80820_GM12878_cohesin_HiChIP_chr21_hg38_bio2.bedpe.gz -o hichip -m 4 -j -s -w 
```    
Then use jd2juice to convert cLoops temp files to hic file for juicebox:
```
jd2juice -d hichip -o hichip -org hg38 
``` 
With the adjustment of resolution, color range and how to show the loops, then you can get following visualization:

### 3. Hi-C data   
We provide test data from GM12878 Hi-C, just the chromosome 21 mapped to hg38. Run the the command as following to call loops.
```
wget https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops_supplementaryData/blob/master/examples/GSM1551552_GM12878_HiC_chr21_hg38.bedpe.gz 
cLoops -f GSM1551552_GM12878_HiC_chr21_hg38.bedpe.gz -o hic -w -j -eps 5000,7500,10000 -minPts 20,30 -s -hic 
```   
or just run following for version >= 0.9:

```
cLoops -f GSM1551552_GM12878_HiC_chr21_hg38.bedpe.gz -o hic -w -j -s -m 3
```   

### 4. Fingerprint plot for data qualities comparasion of loops calling 
Run following and you will get [a PDF plot](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops_supplementaryData/blob/master/examples/compare_fingerprint.pdf), the far from the random line, the better for the data used to call loops by cLoops. You can using this to estimate data qualities between samples.
```
jd2fingerprint -d chiapet,hichip,hic -plot 1 -o compare -bs 2000
```

### 5. call stripes
Since v0.91 (2018-05-17 release), we introduce a new script callStripe, which can identify stripes (a structure defined in [***The Energetics and Physiological Impact of Cohesin Extrusion***](https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(18)30404-5)). However, the original paper hasn't released their data, so we demonstrate the the result using H3K27ac HiChIP data in K562, which from the heatmap we can observe a lot of similar stripes.
We provided the H3K27ac HiChIP data in K562 chr21 for testing. Parameters tuning maybe needed for other data, please email caoyaqiang0410@gmail.com or chenzhaoxiong@picb.ac.cn for tuning parameters for your data. 
```
wget https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops_supplementaryData/blob/master/examples/GSE101498_K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_rep1.bedpe.gz
wget https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops_supplementaryData/blob/master/examples/GSE101498_K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_rep2.bedpe.gz
wget https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops_supplementaryData/blob/master/examples/GSE101498_K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_rep3.bedpe.gz
#first call loops to save the middle files, you can kill cLoops once the .jd files are generated
cLoops -f GSE101498_K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_rep1.bedpe.gz,GSE101498_K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_rep2.bedpe.gz,GSE101498_K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_rep3.bedpe.gz -o K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_chr21 -minPts 20,30 -eps 2500,5000,7500,10000 -hic -s -j -c chr21
#call stripes
callStripes -d K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_chr21 -o K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_chr21 -c chr21 -j
#for visualization in juicebox
jd2juice -d K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_chr21/ -o K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_chr21 -org hg38

```
After above command, you will get two files (with suffix juicebox.txt,[K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_chr21_x_horizontal_juicebox.txt](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops_supplementaryData/blob/master/examples/K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_chr21_x_horizontal_juicebox.txt) and [K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_chr21_y_vertical_juicebox.txt](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops_supplementaryData/blob/master/examples/K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_chr21_y_vertical_juicebox.txt) that could be used for furthur analysis and loaded in Juicebox as 2D annotation as following example:
![](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops/raw/master/pngs/K562_H3K27ac_HiChIP_stripes.png)
Two extra files with file type as .stripe ([K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_chr21_x_horizontal.stripe](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops_supplementaryData/blob/master/examples/K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_chr21_x_horizontal.stripe) and [K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_chr21_y_vertical.stripe](https://github.com/YaqiangCao/cLoops_supplementaryData/blob/master/examples/K562_HiChIP_H3K27ac_chr21_y_vertical_juicebox.txt)) is similar to that of .loop file.
Please note, it's a initial experimental function added in v0.91, not well tested for all data. We'll make improvements when the deep-sequenced Hi-C data is available.

--------
## Other data  
In theory cLoops could be applied to more 3D genomic data as long as there are enriched clusters in the heatmap, however, parameters and significance cutoffs should be tuned. We're now trying to make cLoops work for [GRID-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3968) and [Capture HiC](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3286). If you have designed a new sequencing based 3D genomic method and want to try cLoops, please contact caoyaqiang0410@gmail.com first.

## Questions & Answers  
Please address questions and bugs to Yaqiang Cao (caoyaqiang0410@gmail.com) or Daosheng Ai (aidaosheng@picb.ac.cn) or Zhaoxiong Chen (chenzhaoxiong@picb.ac.cn), using the subject as "cLoops: questions about" to escape misjudged as spams.  

Following are selected questions:

-------
1. HiC-Pro to bedpe     
The [allValidPairs](http://nservant.github.io/HiC-Pro/MANUAL.html#browsing-the-results) can be converted to BEDPE file. You can define a extension size (like half of the reads length) along the reads strand direction. In cLoops' first step, all coordinates are converted from (startA+endA)/2,(startB+endB)/2 to (x,y), so actually the extension size doesn't matter.

2. inter-chromosomal loops    
So far cLoops doesn't support calling inter-chromosomal loops, as there are few significant inter-chromosomal loops called for our tested data and it takes a long time to run. However, we'll try to implement a script for calling this kind of loops for next version as soon as there's available testing data.
